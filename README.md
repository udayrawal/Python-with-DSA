# Learning Python & DSA

This repo is where I’m practicing **Python while learning DSA**.

I’m focusing on solving questions, improving my logic, and getting comfortable writing code without copying solutions. Most of the code here comes from daily practice, mistakes, and debugging.

Python is just the language I’m using — the real goal is to **crack DSA and interview questions**.

I’ll keep adding more problems as I learn and get better.
